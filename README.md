Socialingo is an application for practicing languages giving its users the ability to chat and socialize with native speakers (or professionals in the language). It also allows users to post sentences asking the community of the application about their correctness. Learners can test their vocabulary through randomly generated quizzes based on flashcards with categories and levels. Socialingo keeps the learners more interested by sending suggestions about books, songs and movies in the language they are learning.

System Proposal

Project Title: Socialingo

Project Sponsor: Team Name: Joseph & Elie Team members: Joseph Jreije And Elie Tannous Moderator: Dr. Charbel Fakhry Department: Computer Science Phone: 76065915(J), 71341168(E) E-mail: joseph_jreije@hotmail.com, elie.a.tannous@std.balamand.edu.lb I- Introduction and goals A. Business Need: (overview of the project, what is the problem it solves) There aren’t many resources to practice languages so our project groups many functionalities to help users practice languages.

B. Rational for choosing the project: When learning a new language, a lot of times we lose motivation or find it hard to find a way to practice the language and this app solves this problem by making it fun and social to practice languages. If someone wants to travel or immigrate to a country it is better if they practice its language with a native and get used to the informal way of speaking (because it is kind of different from what textbooks teach).

C. Functionalities: Chat with natives or experts in the language. Post sentences asking people if they are formulated correctly and get corrections (correction posts have an evaluation system for users to vote if it is helpful). Make flashcards with categories and take a randomly generated quiz based on the categories they choose. Get movies, songs and books suggestions.

D. Expected Value: Tangible: Database about language learners More movies, songs and books sales

Intangible: Users learn languages more efficiently and are have fun while doing it

E. Special Issues or Constraints: Time: We probably won’t have enough time to complete everything and leave out the flashcard or the media suggestion features. Familiarity with the technology: We are not familiar with the APIs we’re going to use for movie and books. It is the first time we make a chat app so we are not very familiar with this kind of functionality.

F. Business Plan (How this project is important to users) Make the user’s learning experience fun. Users learn informal language and dialects which are not taught in textbooks. Users practice vocabulary with organized flashcards to find specific words easily. There is a community that helps users, answers their questions and corrects their mistakes.

G. The final product A language practicing application written in Javascript with React. Users database SRS document Final report

Feasibility Analysis

Technical Feasibility: Can We Build It? • Familiarity with Application We are somewhat familiar with the application functionality, however there are challenges that are on the way like learning to make the chatting application and creating suggestions for users and also creating a post and ability to correct the post, however creating login, register, quizzes and manipulating the database will be easier because we worked on similar functionalities in previous projects.

• Familiarity with Technology Since our project is going to be in react which a technology that was introduced last semester in advances in computer science. We were able to get familiar with technology and understand its functionality due to the projects that we worked on.

• Project Size: the project size is 2. Elie Tannous and Joseph Jreije will work on the project.

Economic Feasibility: Should We Build It? • Development Costs: 0$

• Annual Operating Costs: 330$ server cost

• Annual Benefits (Cost Savings and Revenues): 400$ ads

• Intangible Costs and Benefits More users will increase our ads income Gaining popularity

Organizational Feasibility: If We Build It, Will They Come? • Project Champion(s): Elie Tannous and Joseph Jreije

• Senior Management: Elie Tannous and Joseph Jreije

• Users: People who want to practice a language that they are learning

• Other Stakeholders
